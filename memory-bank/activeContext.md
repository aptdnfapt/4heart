# Active Context: AI Persona Discord Bot Collection

## 1. Current Work Focus
- Completed implementation of basic NLU for greetings and simple questions, and basic single persona response in `bot.py`.
- Resolved the duplicate message issue by implementing a message ID cache and refactoring `on_message` logic.
- Ready to return to planning for the next steps in Phase 1 and beyond.

## 2. Recent Changes
- `bot.py` updated:
    - Implemented a message ID cache (`PROCESSED_MESSAGES_CACHE`) to prevent duplicate message processing.
    - Refactored `on_message` logic to explicitly handle 'greeting', 'simple_question', and 'general_chat' intents, ensuring only one AI response is generated per message.
    - Included fallbacks for AI failures in greeting and simple question handling.
- Basic NLU for greetings and simple questions, and basic single persona response were previously implemented.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)
- Update Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect completed work and resolved issues.
- User to switch back to PLAN MODE.
- In PLAN MODE, discuss and plan the next steps, likely focusing on setting up the initial SQLite database and further refining the single persona/NLU.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Project Scope:** The project aims for a highly natural, NLU-driven interaction model for multiple AI personas, including activities like Truth or Dare. This is a complex undertaking.
- **Technology Stack (Initial):** Python with `discord.py`, Gemini API for AI.
- **Memory Bank Adherence:** Strictly following the `.clinerules` for documentation and workflow.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Emerging)
- Emphasis on natural, human-like interaction over command-based systems.
- Desire for immersive role-playing experience.
- User-defined personalities for AI personas.
- The Memory Bank system itself is a core pattern for this project's development.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
- The shift from a simple bot to a complex NLU-driven multi-persona system significantly increases development complexity, particularly around state management and reliable intent recognition.
- Clear documentation via the Memory Bank is critical, especially given the potential for interruptions or context shifts.
