# Active Context: AI Persona Discord Bot Collection

## 1. Current Work Focus
- Memory Bank initialization complete.
- Preparing to discuss the first implementation steps for the AI Persona Discord Bot Collection with the user.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- All core Memory Bank files are now initialized.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)
- Review the overall plan (as documented in the Memory Bank) with the user.
- Discuss and define the first concrete implementation steps for Phase 1 (Basic Bot Setup & Single Persona Interaction) as outlined in `progress.md`.
- Begin implementation of Phase 1.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Project Scope:** The project aims for a highly natural, NLU-driven interaction model for multiple AI personas, including activities like Truth or Dare. This is a complex undertaking.
- **Technology Stack (Initial):** Python with `discord.py`, Gemini API for AI.
- **Memory Bank Adherence:** Strictly following the `.clinerules` for documentation and workflow.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Emerging)
- Emphasis on natural, human-like interaction over command-based systems.
- Desire for immersive role-playing experience.
- User-defined personalities for AI personas.
- The Memory Bank system itself is a core pattern for this project's development.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
- The shift from a simple bot to a complex NLU-driven multi-persona system significantly increases development complexity, particularly around state management and reliable intent recognition.
- Clear documentation via the Memory Bank is critical, especially given the potential for interruptions or context shifts.
