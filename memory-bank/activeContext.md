# Active Context: AI Persona Discord Bot Collection

## 1. Current Work Focus
- **Phase 1 Complete.** Basic bot setup, single persona response, basic NLU, database logging, history context, and bug fixes (duplicates, indentation) are implemented and tested.
- Preparing to plan **Phase 2: Multi-Persona Management & Interaction**.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Successfully fixed `IndentationError` in `bot.py` using `write_to_file`.
- User confirmed database (`discord_bot_data.db`) is created, messages are logged, and bot uses history context across restarts.
- Completed implementation and testing of database integration in `bot.py`.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)
- Update Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect Phase 1 completion.
- User to switch to PLAN MODE.
- In PLAN MODE, discuss and plan the architecture and implementation strategy for Phase 2 (Multi-Persona Management).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Project Scope:** The project aims for a highly natural, NLU-driven interaction model for multiple AI personas, including activities like Truth or Dare. This is a complex undertaking.
- **Technology Stack (Initial):** Python with `discord.py`, Gemini API for AI.
- **Memory Bank Adherence:** Strictly following the `.clinerules` for documentation and workflow.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Emerging)
- Emphasis on natural, human-like interaction over command-based systems.
- Desire for immersive role-playing experience.
- User-defined personalities for AI personas.
- The Memory Bank system itself is a core pattern for this project's development.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
- The shift from a simple bot to a complex NLU-driven multi-persona system significantly increases development complexity, particularly around state management and reliable intent recognition.
- Clear documentation via the Memory Bank is critical, especially given the potential for interruptions or context shifts.
