# Progress: AI Persona Discord Bot Collection

## 1. What Works (Current State: Phase 1 - Basic NLU & Single Persona Response Complete)
- **Memory Bank Structure:** All core Memory Bank files are initialized and up-to-date.
- **Project Definition:** High-level goals, scope, and technical approach are documented.
- **Basic Project Files Created:** `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `bot.py`.
- **Configuration Loading:** Bot loads credentials and settings from `.env`.
- **Basic Logging:** Implemented.
- **Discord Connection:** Bot connects and logs readiness.
- **Duplicate Message Handling:** Message ID cache implemented in `bot.py` to prevent processing duplicate events. (Issue Resolved)
- **Basic NLU:** Bot detects greetings and simple questions (e.g., "how are you").
- **Single Persona Response:** Bot uses a placeholder persona prompt ("Luna") to generate AI responses for greetings, simple questions, and general chat. Includes fallbacks for AI failures.

## 2. What's Left to Build (High-Level Roadmap)
- **Phase 1: Basic Bot Setup & Single Persona Interaction (Mostly Complete)**
    - Basic `discord.py` bot structure. (Done)
    - Configuration loading (bot token, API keys, designated channel). (Done)
    - Connection to Discord. (Done)
    - Implementation of a single AI persona. (Done - basic implementation)
    - Basic message handling: receive user message, send to AI, display AI response. (Done)
    - Simple NLU for greetings and basic questions. (Done - basic implementation)
    - Initial SQLite database setup for minimal state. (To Do)
- **Phase 2: Multi-Persona Management & Interaction**
    - System for managing multiple persona profiles and prompts.
    - Logic for personas to respond individually and potentially interact with each other in simple ways.
    - Basic context management for conversations.
- **Phase 3: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for Activities**
    - NLU to detect intent for starting/participating in "Truth or Dare."
    - NLU to understand who is addressing whom.
- **Phase 4: Truth or Dare Game Logic**
    - State management for T&D games (players, turns, current question/dare).
    - Logic for AI personas to choose truth/dare, ask questions, and provide dares.
    - Handling of user participation in T&D.
    - Roleplay action parsing and generation (`**action**`).
- **Phase 5: Advanced Interaction & Refinements**
    - Real-time clock integration for time-aware interactions.
    - More sophisticated conversational context management.
    - Handling of users joining/leaving the channel/game seamlessly.
    - Collaborative truth/dare suggestion mechanism.
    - Iterative improvement of persona consistency and NLU accuracy.
- **Phase 6: Deployment & Testing**
    - Packaging for deployment.
    - Comprehensive testing on a live Discord server.
    - Monitoring and bug fixing.

## 3. Current Status
- **Date:** (To be filled dynamically or by user - for now, placeholder)
- **Overall Progress:** Phase 1 mostly complete. Basic bot functionality with single persona response and simple NLU is working. Duplicate message issue resolved.
- **Current Focus:** Updating Memory Bank, preparing to switch to PLAN MODE to discuss next steps.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers (Anticipated / Resolved)
- **Duplicate Message Responses:** (Resolved) Implemented message ID cache and refactored `on_message` logic.
- **NLU Complexity:** (Anticipated) Current NLU is very basic. Achieving reliable natural language understanding for diverse user inputs and game states will be a significant challenge in later phases.
- **AI Context Management:** (Anticipated) Keeping AI personas coherent and in-character over extended conversations within API context limits will require careful management.
- **API Rate Limits:** (Anticipated) Potential for hitting Discord or Gemini API rate limits, requiring careful management, especially with multiple personas.
- **Multi-Persona Dynamics:** (Anticipated) Ensuring believable and non-chaotic interactions when multiple AIs and users are conversing will be complex.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Concept:** A collection of 3-5 AI Discord bots for Truth or Dare.
- **Refinement (User Feedback):** Evolved into a more ambitious 24/7 role-playing channel with 4 AI "sister/friend" personas. Emphasis shifted heavily towards natural, command-free interaction, with Truth or Dare as one possible activity. The "Game Master" concept was softened into a more distributed, conversational flow.
- **Memory Bank Implementation:** Adopted `.clinerules` for structured documentation and project memory.
